== Usage

=== Constructing a ParallaxScroll

[source, python]
----
image foo = ParallaxScroll(
    (1920, 1080),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/10.png", 0.0),    # Doesn't scroll
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/08.png", 0.001),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/08.png", 0.0025),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/07.png", 0.005),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/06.png", 0.0075),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/05.png", 0.025),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/04.png", 0.025),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/03.png", 0.05),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/02.png", 0.05),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/01.png", 0.075),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/00.png", 0.1),    # Scrolls 10% of it's width per second
)

==== `+__init__+` Signature

.Positional Arguments
--
[cols="1h,2m,7a"]
|===
| dimensions
| tuple[int, int]
| A two-tuple containing the width and height of the displayable in the format
`(width, height)`.

| *layers
| tuple[Displayable, float]
| One or more two-tuples that each contain a displayable to render (which may be
an image path/name) and a float which represents the scrolling speed of the
layer.

The layers are ordered back to front, meaning the first given layer will be the
furthest from the player while the last given layer will be the closest.
|===
--

.Keyword Arguments
--
[cols="1h,2m,7a"]
|===
| direction
| "left" \| "right"
| A string value that must be one of `"left"` or `"right"` that controls the
direction in which the layers will scroll.

Defaults to `"left"`.

| render_delay
| float
| Controls the delay between Displayable re-renders.

Defaults to `0.01`
|===
--


=== Advanced Usage

The `ParallaxScroll` class extends Ren'Py's `Transform` type, meaning any
normal transform keyword argument is permitted and will be applied to the
`ParallaxScroll`.

For example, the colors of the parallax may be inverted by doing the following:

[source, python]
----
ParallaxScroll(
  ... # dimensions
  ... # layers
  matrixcolor=InvertMatrix(1.0)
)
----

The exception to the above rule is the `crop` keyword argument, which is used
to contain the scrollable within it's configured size boundaries.  Specifying
the `crop` keyword will result in an `Exception` being raised.
