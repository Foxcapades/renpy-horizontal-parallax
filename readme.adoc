== Usage

=== Via Statement Block

[source, python]
----
h_parallax foo:
    "images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/10.png" 0.0    # Doesn't scroll
    "images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/09.png" 0.001
    "images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/08.png" 0.0025
    "images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/07.png" 0.005
    "images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/06.png" 0.0075
    "images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/05.png" 0.025
    "images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/04.png" 0.025
    "images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/03.png" 0.05
    "images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/02.png" 0.05
    "images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/01.png" 0.075
    "images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/00.png" 0.1    # Scrolls 10% of its width per second
----


The `h_parallax` statement declares a new parallax image with the given name
("foo" in the above example) constructed of the frames and frame scroll speeds
given in the following block.

Each line in the block may be one of the following things:

* An image name/path followed by a scroll speed value.
* The `height` keyword followed by an int value declaring the ``h_parallax``'s
display height.
* The `width` keyword followed by an int value declaring the ``h_parallax``'s
display width.
* The `direction` keyword followed by either the string `'left'` or `'right'`.
* The `render_delay` keyword followed by a float value declaring the delay
between frames in the scrolling animation.

The given layers are rendered in back to front order with the first declared
layer being on the bottom and the last declared layer being on top.

==== Optional Properties

`height <int>`::
A height value for the `h_parallax`.  Controls the display height that the
parallax scroll will be cropped to.  This value should match the size of the
images being used in the scroll.
+
Defaults to `config.screen_height`.
+
[source, python]
----
h_parallax bar:
    height 600
----

`width <int>`::
A width value for the `h_parallax`.  Controls the display width that the
parallax scroll will be cropped to.  This value should match the size of the
images being used in the scroll.
+
Defaults to `config.screen_width`.
+
[source, python]
----
h_parallax fizz:
    width 800
----

`direction <"left"|"right">`::
The scroll direction for the parallax scroll.  Must be one of the strings
`"left"` or `"right"`.
+
A value of `"left"` causes the parallax scroll to move from right to left.  A
value of `"right"` causes the parallax scroll to move from left to right.
+
Defaults to `"left"`.
+
[source, python]
----
h_parallax buzz:
    direction "left"
----

`render_delay <float>`::
The delay between render frames for the scroll.  A smaller value means a
smoother animation.
+
Defaults to `0.01`
+
[source, python]
----
h_parallax foo:
    render_delay 0.01
----


=== Via Class Constructor

[source, python]
----
image foo = ParallaxScroll(
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/10.png", 0.0),    # Doesn't scroll
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/09.png", 0.001),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/08.png", 0.0025),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/07.png", 0.005),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/06.png", 0.0075),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/05.png", 0.025),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/04.png", 0.025),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/03.png", 0.05),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/02.png", 0.05),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/01.png", 0.075),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/00.png", 0.1),    # Scrolls 10% of its width per second
)

==== `+__init__+`

[source, python]
----
def __init__(self, *layers, **kwargs)
----

===== Positional Arguments

`*layers : tuple[renpy.Displayable | str, float]`::
+
One or more two-tuples that each contain a displayable to render and a float
which represents the scrolling speed of the layer.
+
The first value of each tuple MUST be either an instance of renpy.Displayable
(Composite, Image, Transform, etc.) or a string representing the name of or path
to a defined image or an image file.
+
The second value of each tuple MUST be a float value between `0.0` and `1.0`
inclusive.  This value represents the percent of the layer image's width that
will scroll across the screen per second.
+
The layers are ordered back to front, meaning the first given layer will be the
furthest from the player while the last given layer will be the closest.


===== Keyword Arguments

`direction : "left"|"right"`::
+
Controls the direction the ParallaxScroll layers will scroll.
+
A value of "left" means the layers will scroll from right to left, where a value
of "right" means the layers will scroll from left to right.
+
Any other value passed as the `direction` argument will cause an exception to be
raised.
+
Defaults to `"left"`.

`render_delay : float`::
+
Controls the delay between Displayable re-renders.
+
Defaults to `0.01`

`height : int`::
+
Controls the display height of the parallax.  The displayable will be cropped to
this height.  This value should match the size of the source image.
+
Defaults to `config.screen_height`

`width : int`::
+
Controls the display width of the parallax.  The displayable will be cropped to
this width.  This value should match the size of the source image.



=== Advanced Usage

The `ParallaxScroll` class extends Ren'Py's `Transform` type, meaning any
normal transform keyword argument is permitted and will be applied to the
`ParallaxScroll`.

For example, the colors of the parallax may be inverted by doing the following:

[source, python]
----
ParallaxScroll(
  ... # dimensions
  ... # layers
  matrixcolor=InvertMatrix(1.0)
)
----

The exception to the above rule is the `crop` keyword argument, which is used
to contain the scrollable within it's configured size boundaries.  Specifying
the `crop` keyword will result in an `Exception` being raised.


=== About Layers

Each layer consists of a single image or Displayable that is repeated on the
x-axis to fill the target width for the ParallaxScroll.  Each layer is stacked
on top of one another in the given order with each layer given it's own scroll
speed to create the parallax effect.

Layer displayables will only be repeated along the x-axis and will be positioned
at the top of the ParallaxScroll bounding box.

While the first layer given (the layer furthest back in the image) may or may
not have transparency, the layers above it should have some transparency to show
through to the layers underneath.  This makes PNG files a perfect fit unless you
are creating the images on the fly via a Creator Defined Displayable or some
other mechanism.
