=== Construction

.Positional Arguments
--
[cols="1h,2m,7a"]
|===
| dimensions
| tuple[int, int]
| A two-tuple containing the width and height of the displayable in the format
`(width, height)`.

| *layers
| tuple[Displayable, float]
| One or more two-tuples that each contain a displayable to render (which may be
an image path/name) and a float which represents the scrolling speed of the
layer.

The layers are ordered back to front, meaning the first given layer will be the
furthest from the player while the last given layer will be the closest.

| "left" \| "right"
| A string value that must be one of `"left"` or `"right"` that controls the
direction in which the layers will scroll.

Defaults to `"left"`.

| render_delay
| float
| Controls the delay between Displayable re-renders.
