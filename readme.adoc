== Usage

=== Constructing a ParallaxScroll

[source, python]
----
image foo = ParallaxScroll(
    (1920, 1080),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/10.png", 0.0),    # Doesn't scroll
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/08.png", 0.001),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/08.png", 0.0025),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/07.png", 0.005),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/06.png", 0.0075),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/05.png", 0.025),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/04.png", 0.025),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/03.png", 0.05),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/02.png", 0.05),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/01.png", 0.075),
    ("images/backgrounds/scrolling_forest/00.png", 0.1),    # Scrolls 10% of it's width per second
)
----

==== `+__init__+` Signature

[source, python]
----
def __init__(self, dimensions, *layers, **kwargs)
----

===== Positional Arguments

`dimensions : tuple[int, int]`::
+
A two-tuple containing the width and height of the displayable in the format
`(width, height)`.


`*layers : tuple[renpy.Displayable | str, float]`::
+
One or more two-tuples that each contain a displayable to render and a float
which represents the scrolling speed of the layer.
+
The first value of each tuple MUST be either an instance of renpy.Displayable
(Composite, Image, Transform, etc.) or a string representing the name of or path
to a defined image or an image file.
+
The second value of each tuple MUST be a float value between `0.0` and `1.0`
inclusive.  This value represents the percent of the layer image's width that
will scroll across the screen per second.
+
The layers are ordered back to front, meaning the first given layer will be the
furthest from the player while the last given layer will be the closest.


===== Keyword Arguments

`direction : "left"|"right"`::
+
Controls the direction the ParallaxScroll layers will scroll.
+
A value of "left" means the layers will scroll from right to left, where a value
of "right" means the layers will scroll from left to right.
+
Any other value passed as the `direction` argument will cause an exception to be
raised.
+
Defaults to `"left"`.

`render_delay : float`::
+
Controls the delay between Displayable re-renders.
+
Defaults to `0.01`


=== Advanced Usage

The `ParallaxScroll` class extends Ren'Py's `Transform` type, meaning any
normal transform keyword argument is permitted and will be applied to the
`ParallaxScroll`.

For example, the colors of the parallax may be inverted by doing the following:

[source, python]
----
ParallaxScroll(
  ... # dimensions
  ... # layers
  matrixcolor=InvertMatrix(1.0)
)
----

The exception to the above rule is the `crop` keyword argument, which is used
to contain the scrollable within it's configured size boundaries.  Specifying
the `crop` keyword will result in an `Exception` being raised.

=== About Layers

Each layer consists of a single image or Displayable that is repeated on the
x-axis to fill the target width for the ParallaxScroll.  Each layer is stacked
on top of one another in the given order with each layer given it's own scroll
speed to create the parallax effect.

Layer displayables will only be repeated along the x-axis and will be positioned
at the top of the ParallaxScroll bounding box.
